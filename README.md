**Description**
For many people, in recent times especially, simply walking the streets of their hometown for everyday activities is dangerous. What's more, reaching into a pocket or bag for a phone -- the best tool in isolated emergencies -- becomes dangerous in many situations. These include police and thief encounters, where an injust scenario is transpiring. This is where Street Guard comes in. Street Guard is a voice-activated emergency-alert app with a specialty -- not only does it trigger emergency text messages, it also starts a recording whenever a police officer or thief is detected, based on a growing database of flagged words. This app is a proof-of-concept, and not meant to be deployed as of yet.
